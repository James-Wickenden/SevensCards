# SevensCards

## About the project

This is a VB.NET Windows Form App card game that implements a variation on the popular card game 'Sevens' (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_(card_game)#Sevens>).

The game supports playing locally against other people or computers, or web play with additional bots.
