# SevensCards

## About the project

---
This is a VB.NET Windows Form App card game that implements a variation on the popular card game 'Sevens' (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_(card_game)#Sevens>).

The game supports playing locally against other people or computers, or web play with additional bots.

The online repository can be found at <https://github.com/James-Wickenden/SevensCards>
